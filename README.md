# VBA-challenge
I started this challenge on Saturday, April 6, 2024, in a Zoom study session with Allison Chase and James Brannan. Our TA Meghan Romona joined the session to check on our progress. The three of us worked together on tackling the project for a couple of hours on Saturday via Zoom and a couple of hours via Slack on Sunday. We recieved guidance from Meghan when we got stumped during our Zoom study session. She helped us think through the purpose of our code. We also recieved instant feedback while running iterations of our code through Xpert AI on our Bootcampspot website. - Matthew Sanders
April 21, 2024: After receiving feedback on note coloring my Percent Change column - I edited my code to work for this new submission. I did notice that the assignment changed slightly (new Excel sheet) since submitting my first submission. - Matthew Sanders
